# Proto UI

> Any Design System ✕ Any Platform Technology

Proto UI is a framework-agnostic UI architecture built on interaction-first principles. Instead of treating components as static visual elements, Proto UI introduces a reusable behavior modeling system—**Prototypes**—to enable cross-platform, design-system-independent UI development.

---

## 🚀 Why Proto UI?

- Write once, run anywhere—React, Vue, Web Components, even native platforms
- Fully customizable behaviors and structure, decoupled from rendering tech
- Minimal runtime overhead, strict separation of concerns
- Accessibility, security, and performance built in from day one

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

    Adapter(Prototype) => Component

Define a behavior model once (Prototype), and apply it across platforms via adapters. Proto UI breaks down interaction into modular, testable, and composable units.

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

Proto UI uses **Vite** as its development environment.

### Requirements

- **Node.js >= 18**
- **npm** or other package managers (e.g. pnpm, yarn)

### Setup

    npm install
    npm run dev

Then open `http://localhost:5173` to explore the local playground.

## 📦 What’s in the Works?

Proto UI is in **early active development**. Here’s what we’re working on:

- ✅ Expanding the **Prototype & Behavior libraries**
- ✅ Supporting more **platform adapters**
- ✅ CLI tool for install-by-source (true zero-runtime, on-demand integration)
- ✅ Growing the **documentation site** and contributor guides
- ✅ Building **customized testing systems** for fast, reliable validation
- ✅ Preparing for **community launch and outreach**—help us warm up the engine 🚀
