# Proto UI Introduction

> Any Design System âœ• Any Platform Technology

## Why Proto UI

Today's component systems are tightly coupled to specific frameworks, making interaction models hard to reuse, migration expensive, and cross-platform implementation painful.

Proto UI aims to rethink UI development by focusing on the essence of interaction. We want to solve problems like:

- **Duplicated components**: The same button needs to be rewritten for React, Vue, Flutter, etc.
- **Non-reusable behaviors**: Interaction logic is tightly bound to view and platform, making abstraction hard.
- **Platform fragmentation**: Every platform requires a ground-up redesign, raising collaboration and maintenance costs.

Proto UI introduces a universal, composable interaction modeling systemâ€”so that designers and developers can focus on _how_ components behave, not _where_ they run.

## Core Concepts

### Component Lifecycle

```
Prototype --Adapter--> Component --Native Framework--> Element
```

#### 1. Prototype

Prototype is an abstract description of the essence of component interaction:

- Decoupled from specific technology implementations
- Focused on behavior and state definition
- Serves as the shared foundation for all implementations
- Ensures behavioral consistency

```typescript
// Prototype example
interface ButtonPrototype {
  setup(hooks: PrototypeHooks): PrototypeSetupResult;
}
```

#### 2. Adapter

Adapter is responsible for converting prototypes into framework-specific components:

- Handles platform-specific lifecycle
- Manages state synchronization mechanism
- Provides event system adaptation
- Implements rendering system conversion

```typescript
// Adapter examples
const WebComponentButton = WebComponentAdapter(ButtonPrototype);
const ReactButton = ReactAdapter(ButtonPrototype);
```

#### 3. Component

The final implementation in various frameworks:

- Follows framework's component model
- Utilizes framework's rendering mechanism
- Reuses framework's optimization strategies
- Performance depends on the framework itself and adapter quality

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   - Separation of behavior and rendering
   - Separation of state and view
   - Isolation of platform-specific code

2. **Minimal Runtime**

   - Streamlined core implementation
   - On-demand feature loading
   - Efficient execution performance

3. **Developer Experience First**

   - Complete type definitions
   - Clear error messages
   - Rich development tools

4. **Progressive Adoption**
   - Start with Web platform
   - Gradually expand to other platforms
   - Smooth upgrade path

## Project Vision

Proto UI is a component generation solution that starts from the essence of interaction, aiming to create a meta-language for interaction. The project will achieve this goal in three phases:

### Phase 1: Web Platform Component Generation Solution

- **Technology Agnostic**

  - Support for any Web technology stack (React, Vue, Web Components, etc.)
  - Write once, run anywhere
  - Minimal framework migration cost

- **Complete Customizability**

  - Flexible component customization
  - Free style adjustments
  - Allow behavior logic rewriting

- **Extreme Performance**

  - Minimal runtime overhead
  - Precise rendering control
  - Efficient state management

- **Web Platform Accessibility**

  - Full WCAG 2.1 compliance
  - ARIA specification compliance
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader optimization

- **Built-in Security**
  - XSS protection
  - Input validation
  - Secure rendering strategy

### Phase 2: Cross-Platform Component Generation Solution

- Extend support to native platforms (iOS, Android)
- Extend support to embedded platforms (Flutter, Qt, Unity, etc.)
- Provide platform-specific accessibility support
- Unified component definition, multi-platform implementation

### Phase 3: Interaction Meta-Language

- Establish a complete interaction modeling language
- Support cross-platform interaction pattern definition
- Achieve verifiability of interaction design
- Provide reusability of interaction patterns
