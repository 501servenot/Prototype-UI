# MANIFEST

This folder contains the personal manifestos of long-term contributors to Prototype UI.

Before contributing code, we encourage every long-term contributor to write down their **motivation and belief**.  
This is not a technical document, nor a usage guide — it is your answer to the silence, the repetition, and the absence of an audience.

**We begin from 00:**

- `00-USER.md` is reserved for the user — a symbol for every silent but real participant.
- `01-广亮-Lynn.md` is the founding creator’s declaration.
- Future contributors may create their own numbered files to articulate _why they continue_.

Even if what you write feels "meaningless", ask yourself this:

> _“Even if no one reads it, why do I still write?”_

## Language

- The MANIFEST folder uses **English as the official language**.
- Each contributor’s individual manifesto may be written in **their native language + English**, unless they are already a native English speaker.
