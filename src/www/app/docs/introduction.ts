            This project is named [Prototype UI](https://github.com/guangliang2019/Prototype-UI), a component generation solution based on Prototype.

            Currently in its early stages, it appears to be a Web Component or pure JavaScript version of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/). Additionally, the documentation site and component styles are inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

            The design philosophy of Prototype UI is \`Adapter(Prototype) => Component\`

            We have used too many technologies to build interfaces, such as React, Vue, Svelte, Solid for the web, native Flutter, Qt, etc. Every time we write UI, we always start with components like Button. We've written Button too many times, yet their interactive essence remains the same.

            Prototype UI hopes to find a balance between interaction and development, seeking a solution that is adaptable enough for all platforms while starting from the essence of interaction.
            
            When the next operating system emerges, we won't need to develop a new set of UI libraries for each design language; when the next design language appears, we won't need to struggle to adapt it to all technical solutions.

            Perhaps when the next interaction system appears, we can have a more reasonable starting point, rather than rewriting Button over and over again.
